# Description:
-----------------------------------------------
This is a MATLAB model that simulates surface EMG signals detected above an elliptical muscle, within a cylindrical limb containing bone, muscle, fat, and skin tissues.
Additionally it is used to model the motor unit (MU) recruitment and firing rate. 
The modelâ€™s basic parameters are described in the following research article: [http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jelekin.2016.12.006]

- The Zip. file comprises of 2 folders; one for circular electrode simulation and the other for rectangular electrode.
- Inside each folder, there is two other sub-folders for each firing strategy. 
- Other parameters (such as the used spacial filter, recruitment thresholds RR, peak firing rate PFR, inter-electrode distances, MVC levels, ...  ) can be manually adjusted as desired.
----------------------------------------------
# How to use ?
----------------------------------------------
- Download the zip. file and extract the files.
- Open your MATLAB program (preferably MATLAB R2020a)
- Scrole into the extracted folders, adjust the parameters as needed and run the FR1 or FR3 files for generating the signals (You need to adjust the name the signals accordinly).
